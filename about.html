                <p>
                    I am a student at Noroff, and am taught frontend web development. This blog is part of the teaching
                    program. </p>
                <p>
                    I'm almost half done with my studies. I study part-time, with 50 percent study progression, and will
                    spend a total of four years until I finish.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Right now you're looking at a blog site I've created. I create a blog using technologies like HTTP,
                    CSS
                    and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So welcome to this site.

                <p>
                    My wife and I are looking forward to the summer holidays this year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are both very enthusiastic cyclists.
                    This year we are planning a cycling holiday in northern Norway. Specifically in Nordland county.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a few years left before I retire. My wife is already retired. She has worked as an anesthesia
                    nurse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fortunately, we are both physically fit, and therefore look forward to a cycling holiday along the
                    coast of Nordland.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you may have already guessed, this blog will be about planning our cycling holiday in Nordland.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We will spend the night in our own tent and in hotels, depending on what suits us best.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope for nice days with sunshine, but are also prepared for rain, and will dress as the weather
                    requires.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When cycling, you pay more attention to nature and the landscape than when driving a car.

                <h2 class="contentSection-heading">How we have planned the holiday</h2>
                <p>
                    We plan daily cycling stages in the region around the towns of Brønnøysund and Sandnessjøen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The whole holiday trip will take about 2 weeks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First we will need a couple of days to drive from our hometown in Krokkleiva to the town of
                    Brønnøysund. The drive will take 13 hours by car. It is about 900 kilometers to drive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Sandnessjøen we will rent bikes and take the ferry to the island Vega. We look forward to a bike
                    ride around the
                    whole of Vega. This island is located right by the sea and the cycling terrain is very flat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will cycle using GPS and physical maps.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentSection-heading">Why would we spend our holiday this way?</h2>
                <p>
                    Cycling will give us a lot of fresh air, which is good for health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Such a holiday would be to do something completely different than we do on a daily basis. It will be
                    a good relaxation and give us a lot of extra energy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will have many shared memories and experiences that we can think back on with joy.
